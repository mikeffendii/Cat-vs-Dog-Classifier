# Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier

Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”).

The Dataset can be found easily on Kaggle or any other website. This dataset consists of 4000 Images each of Cat and Dog in the Training Set and 1000 Images each of Cat and Dog in the Test Set.
